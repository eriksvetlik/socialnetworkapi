# Description

In this assignment, our task was to build an API for a social network application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friends list. This application uses the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) package for routing and the [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) package to interact with a MongoDB database - it also uses the [Moment.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) package to format timestamps.

With the Express APIs, the user is able to view users, thoughts, and reaction information through their respective routes.

JavaScript | Node.js | Mongoose | MongoDB
